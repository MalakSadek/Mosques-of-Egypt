# Mosques-of-Egypt
A web portal that focuses on digital heritage and preservation by promoting Egyptian mosques üïåüè∫(2020).

This website was developed using `Axure RP 9` as an IDE and is written in `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`. Developed during the time of COVID-19, its aim was to aid Egyptian heritage sites, namely historic mosques, to retain potential viewers' interest and curiosity. It serves as an online portal to explore various mosques, combining different forms of media such as 360 photographs, 3D models, historical documents, and audio recordings of calls to prayers. By linking to numerous platforms such as SoundCloud, SketchFab, and RoundMe, instead of creating content from scratch, the website is able to utilize the existing wealth of information and media available on the mosques, but which has never been hollistically integrated into a single portal before. The website also aims to give back to the community and put heritage owners at the heart of the project by providing links to donate to the mosques as well as linking to local online gift shops selling locally hand-made products. The table below shows the different sources of content and how they were integrated into the portal.
